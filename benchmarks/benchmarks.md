# Numerical Benchmarks
## Overview
The accuracy and capability of the developed approach are evaluated using synthetic data generated using analytical constitutive models. Numerically generated data offers the benefit of having exact knowledge of the ground truth, i.e., the constitutive model that underlies the data.

To mimic idealized experiments, numerical data sets for training, validation, and testing are generated using standard protocols in experimental mechanics. For each protocol, stress values and dissipative state variables are sampled at regular intervals. Additionally, the approach's robustness to errors in the training data is assessed by introducing synthetic noise.

## Benchmarks Selection
Two benchmarks are selected to highlight challenges in learning constitutive representations in small data regimes: a one-state variable model (\(\bm{\varepsilon}^e\)) and a three-state variables model (\(\rho, \bm{\varepsilon}^e, \mathbf{z}\)).

## Data Splitting
The entire data set is split into training, validation, and test sets in approximately a 60-20-20% ratio.

## Implementation Details
The new algorithm is implemented using the deep learning library **PyTorch** [^1] and the package **torchdiffeq** [^2] for time integration and back-propagation. The explicit midpoint method is used with a time step \(h = \frac{T}{800}\).

For conciseness, the comparison with the common incremental formulation is discussed in [Appendix A](#appendixA).

## Elasto-plastic Media
### Model Description
The first example concerns an incrementally nonlinear elasto-plastic, non-associative, Drucker-Prager material with constant density [^3]. The specific internal energy is defined as:

\[
\widehat{u}(\bm{\varepsilon^e}) = \dfrac{1}{2}K{\varepsilon_v^e}^2 + \dfrac{3}{2}G{\varepsilon^e_s}^2
\]

### Model Parameters
\(K=70\) GPa, \(G=60\) GPa, friction coefficient equal to one, seismic parameter equal to one, and dilatancy parameter equal to one half.

### Data Generation
Data is generated by applying single loading-unloading paths with constant strain rate. The material stress is identified in terms of its volumetric and deviatoric parts.

### Neural Network Architecture
The neural operator \(\bm{f}_{\bm{\theta}}\) and \({u}_{\bm{\omega}}\) architectures are detailed in the implementation section.

## Elasto-plastic Porous Media
### Model Description
The second example concerns elasto-plastic porous media [^4]. The reference constitutive model is built on three state variables: elastic strain (\(\varepsilon^e\)), bulk density (\(\rho\)), and solid fraction \(\phi=\rho/\rho_s\).

### Model Parameters
Bulk modulus \(K=10\) MPa, shear modulus \(G=6\) MPa, critical state line slope \(M=1.5\), effective isotropic yield pressure \(\beta^*=0.1\), and unstressed solid density \(\rho_s^*=600\) kg/mÂ³.

### Data Generation
Data is generated by applying single loading-unloading strain-loading paths with constant strain rate. Four specimens with different initial solid fractions are considered.

### Neural Network Architecture
The neural operator \(\bm{f}_{\bm{\theta}}\) and \({u}_{\bm{\omega}}\) architectures are detailed in the implementation section.
